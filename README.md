## Auburn University Travel Website. 
  Introduction: 
For our project, we plan to develop a travel website oriented specifically towards Auburn University students. The website includes a variety of features that are tailored to meet the needs of students who are looking to explore the United States. Provided you have an Auburn University username and password, you can track your subscribed to destination choice, flights, and Booking.com bookings. On the browsing page users will be allowed to view popular destinations around the US. Viewing specific destinations will show  youinformation on flights from ATL to you specific destination closest airport. These flights will be listed along with Hotels's within a 50 mile radius of the page. Cost and date for both the flight and airBNB will be included on this page so that any viewer can estimate the cost and timing of their trip. Additionally, destination ratings from previous students will be available for any user that wants an idea of what others thought about a destination. The point of this website is for students to track, plan, and review destinations for travel.
